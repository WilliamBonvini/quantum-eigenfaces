# Quantum Eigenfaces

Implementation of the research paper [*Quantum Eigenfaces: Linear Feature Mapping and Nearest Neighbor Classification with Outlier Detection*](https://re.public.polimi.it/bitstream/11311/1257173/1/Quantum_Eigenfaces__Linear_Feature_Mapping_and_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification_with_Outlier_Detection___IEEEQCE23.pdf).

### Quick Setup

1. **Install Poetry**: Ensure [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is installed for Python dependency management.
2. **Clone the Repo**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. **Create a Jupyter Kernel**: In the repository's root directory, run `make kernel` in the terminal to set up the "quantum-eigenfaces" Jupyter kernel.
4. **Start Jupyter**: Launch Jupyter Notebook with `jupyter notebook`.
5. **Access Notebooks**: Navigate to the "notebook" folder in Jupyter and open the desired notebook.
6. **Activate the Kernel**: In the notebook, go to 'Kernel' > 'Change kernel', and select "quantum-eigenfaces".
